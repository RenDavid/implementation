This code is highly inspired by the paper "Fast, Approximate Piecewise-Planar Modeling Based on Sparse Structure-from-Motion and Superpixels" by Andras Bodis-Szomoru, Hayko Riemenschneider and Luc Van Gool (The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014, pp. 469-476).

The code takes as input a directory containing png, PNG, jpg or JPG files as well as the NVM output file from Visual SfM.
Directory paths are currently hardcoded in, which is obviously not good.
In fact, the whole thing needs a good going over.

I build this on my machine (Ubuntu, amd64 processor) using the buildAll command (see contents of repo).
